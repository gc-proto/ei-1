	<p>As of December 3, 2017, 2 family caregiver benefits (the benefits) are available to eligible caregivers who are providing care or support to a patient who is critically ill or injured. Caregivers must be family members or someone who is considered to be like family by the person needing care or support.</p>
	<p><strong>The Family Caregiver Benefit  for Children,</strong> previously known as the Parents of Critically Ill Children benefit (PCIC),  provides financial assistance to caregivers providing care or support to a  critically ill or injured child who is under the age of 18. Caregivers can receive  up to 35 weeks of this benefit.</p>
	<p><strong>The Family Caregiver Benefit for Adults</strong> provides financial assistance to caregivers providing care or support to a critically ill or injured adult who is 18 years of age or older. Caregivers can receive up to 15 weeks of this benefit.</p>
	<p>As a medical doctor or nurse practitioner, you may be asked to complete a <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242B">medical certificate</a> indicating the patient is critically ill or injured to support their caregiver’s application for either benefit. The medical certificate along with an <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242A">Authorization to release a medical certificate</a> must be submitted to Service Canada by the caregiver who intends to apply for either benefit.</p>
	<section>
		<h3 id="h2.3-h3.1">What is the definition of a critically ill or injured person?</h3>
		<p>Any person whose baseline state of health has changed significantly and whose life is at risk as a result of illness or injury. For the purpose of these benefits, they must also require the care or support of one or more caregivers.</p>
		<p>Please note the presence of a long-term condition on its own, where there is no immediate threat to life, would not meet the eligibility criteria for the benefits. A new and acute life-threatening event that significantly changes the person’s baseline state of health must occur in order for a claimant to qualify.</p>

			<h4 id="h2.3-h3.2-h4.2">Care or support</h4>
			<p>Care is defined as all care that is required because of a critically ill or injured patient’s state of health, other than the care provided by a health care professional.</p>
			<p>Support is defined as all psychological or emotional support that is required because of a critically ill or injured patient’s state of health.</p>
		</section><!-- END h4 -->
		<section>
			<h4 id="h2.3-h3.2-h4.3">Critically ill or injured adult</h4>
			<p>Any person who is critically ill or injured and is 18 years of age or over on the first day of the period set out on the <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242B">medical certificate</a> by the medical doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>
		</section><!-- END h4 -->
		<section>
			<h4 id="h2.3-h3.2-h4.4">Critically ill or injured child</h4>
			<p>Any person who is critically ill or injured and is under the age of 18 on the first day of the period set out on the <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242B">medical certificate</a> by the medical doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>
		</section><!-- END h4 -->
	</section><!-- END h3 -->
	<section>
		<h3 id="h2.3-h3.3">Medical Certificate</h3>
		<p>On the <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242B">medical certificate</a> you must:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Confirm the patient is critically ill or injured</li>
		  <li>State the date you are certifying the patient became critically ill or injured</li>
		  <li>Confirm the patient needs care or support of their caregiver(s), and</li>
		  <li>State the specific time period the critically ill or injured patient is expected to  need care or support; the date on the certificate cannot be unknown or indefinite, but you can issue a second certificate if the timeframe needs to be extended</li>
			<li>Confirm whether or not the patient is able to consent to the release of medical information</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Even if more than one caregiver intends to claim the benefit, only one medical certificate needs to be completed.</p>
	  <p><strong>You can issue a second medical certificate if</strong> the patient requires care or support from a caregiver for a longer timeframe than originally indicated in the first medical certificate. The information on the second certificate should be the same as the first, with an updated estimate of time until which care or support will be required. A new change in the patient’s baseline state of health is not necessary in those circumstances. Benefits are payable (15 weeks for adults and 35 weeks for children) during a 52-week period from the date you indicate in the medical certificate.</p>
	</section><!-- END h3 -->
	<section>
		<h3 id="h2.3-h3.4">Authorization to Release a Medical Certificate</h3>
		<p>We understand medical doctors and nurse practitioners cannot release medical information about a patient without their consent. As such, we ask claimants to complete and submit the <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242A">Authorization to Release a Medical Certificate for Employment Insurance</a> form along with the <a rel="external" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5242B">medical certificate</a>. We ask the patient to sign this form to confirm their consent.</p>
		<p>Section D of the medical certificate asks you to assess the patient’s capacity for consent. If the patient is a child or is an adult who is unable to consent to the release of their medical information because of a physical or mental condition, the patient’s legally authorized representative can sign the Authorization to release a medical certificate form instead.</p>
	</section><!-- END h3 -->
	<section>
		<h3 id="h2.3-h3.5">If the patient resides outside of Canada</h3>
		<p>In cases where the critically ill or injured patient in need of care or support resides outside of Canada, the medical certificate may be signed by a person who is authorized by the appropriate governmental authority of a country other than Canada to perform the work of a medical doctor or of a nurse practitioner and who has professional qualifications that are substantially similar to those of a medical doctor or of a nurse practitioner practicing in Canada.</p>
